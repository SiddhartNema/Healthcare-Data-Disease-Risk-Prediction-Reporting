# 🏥 Healthcare Data – Disease Risk Prediction & Reporting

A real-world, end-to-end **Healthcare Predictive Analytics** project built as part of a job simulation with MedXCare Analytics. This collaborative assignment was completed by a 6-member analytics team to help predict chronic disease risks (like diabetes and heart disease) using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

A partner hospital shared EHR data containing patient demographics, test results, symptoms, history, and lifestyle indicators. The goal was to:
- Predict high-risk patients using ML
- Explore trends using EDA
- Build a Power BI dashboard for business users
- Generate a strategy to reduce chronic disease occurrence

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Predict disease risk using machine learning
2. Segment high-risk patients by age, gender, and location
3. Provide key insights from EDA and SQL analysis
4. Design an interactive Power BI dashboard
5. Recommend targeted health strategies

## 🧠 Sample Interview Questions We Prepared For

### ML / Python
- How did you handle class imbalance?
- What does AUC-ROC tell in a healthcare setting?

### EDA
- What age group showed the highest disease risk?
- Which feature had the strongest correlation with disease?

### SQL
- How did you identify high-risk clusters?
- Write a query to extract patients with BP > 140 and high cholesterol.

### Power BI
- What visuals helped stakeholders the most?
- How does region/gender filtering impact insights?

### Strategy
- What intervention campaigns can be run based on your findings?
- How do you ensure ethical and secure use of this data?
